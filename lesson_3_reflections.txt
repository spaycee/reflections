When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When I am collaborating with others, and when I may be working from different devices
  or locations.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
 automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  Perhaps in situations where others are making changes to the repository as well,
  and you would not want your work to be overwritten without warning.
