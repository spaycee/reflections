When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When I am collaborating with others, and when I may be working from different devices
  or locations.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
 automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  Perhaps in situations where others are making changes to the repository as well,
  and you would not want your work to be overwritten without warning.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use
 one instead of another?
  FORK: a copy of a repository on GitHub with the copy also on GitHub
  CLONE: a local copy of another repository
  BRANCH: copy within the same repository
  I would Fork if I wanted the copy to remain on GitHub and be linked to the
   original; or if I wanted to make changes to a repository which I have no write
   access to. I would clone typically to make a local copy of a repository so I
   can better edit the contents. Branch: when I want to make changes within a
   repository without changing the main stuff.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
  In situations where commits are made to the remote copy that are not in the local,
  that might conflict with local commits that have not been pushed to the remote;
  one can review the changes made before merging them.
